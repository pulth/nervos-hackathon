# Pulth's Descentralized String Saver

This is a modification of the Simple Storage Application. In this modification you can store strings. The button bellow will deploy a smart contract where you can store a string. By default the initial stored value is "Nervos". After the contract is deployed you can either read stored string from the smart contract or set a new one. You can do that using the interface below.
